# WikiDisputes

This is the repository for the paper: "I beg to differ: A study of constructive disagreement in online conversations" (De Kock and Vlachos, 2020). 

The zipped data folder contains two .json files: escalated.json and not_escalated.json. These files both consist of lists of samples. Each sample contains two dictionaries: 'dispute' and 'conversation'.
- 'Dispute' contains metadata surrounding the dispute tag or the mediation (in the 'escalated' case).
- 'Conversation' contains a list of utterance dicts.

The file sampled_data.json.zip contains a subsampled dataset with N=2195.
